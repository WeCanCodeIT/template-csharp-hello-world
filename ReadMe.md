# We Can Code It

## Introduction

> Many programming tutorials start with a "Hello World" project. This is normally considered a working proof of concept for whatever programming language you are using.

## Code Samples

> You should read and practice using some of the tutorials/examples found on the [Microsoft Documentation - Console class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console?view=net-6.0)
<br /><br />
>When you are using Console.WriteLine or Console.ReadLine what is it that you using? Look up programming methods for a hint.
<br /><br />
>Datatypes like int, double, float, and sometimes string are considered  simple types.
<br /><br />
>C# is a strongly typed language that means in coding the data type must always proceed the variable declaration. Read more about data types on [TutorialsTeacher.com/csharp/csharp-data-types](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-data-types)

## Installation

> When considering if you need a variable, you must first ask, what type of data do I need to store this variable.

>If a method returns something, think first about what type the method returns, then start your statement: 
<br /><br />
<code>data type | variable name | assignment operator | method being called</code>
<br /><br />
>Example:
<br /><br />
<code>string myName = Console.ReadLine()</code>
